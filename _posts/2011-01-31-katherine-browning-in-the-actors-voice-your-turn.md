[Katherine Browning](/people/katherine-browning/) is featured in the *Your Turn* section of this week’s [The Actors Voice](http://more.showfax.com/columns/avoice/) by [Bonnie Gillespie](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1024379/). From the article:

> *Napoleon Bon Appétit* was an idea sprung from her mind and made real through her determination and organizational skills. She found the best deals on rental equipment, dealt with the SAG New Media division, found our DP, secured our location, and dozens of other responsibilities that I couldn’t have hoped to handle on my own. And when it finally came time to shoot, she created a hilarious and captivating character out of dialogue that consisted of nothing but recipe instructions.
