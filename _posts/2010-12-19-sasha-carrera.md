Sasha Carrera generally won’t go near quiche lorraine, but does have a fondness for quiche florentine. Most recent theatrical foodie experiences include *Dinner with Friends* (Italian food– lemon polenta especially wonderful); *Aunt Dan and Lemon* (makes you THINK of citrus though I didn’t actually eat anything); *Anonymous Dreams* (ok, I was a crack whore so I couldn’t eat anything on film, but I did spend some time at craft services). Keep an eye out next season for Terri’s twin, Merri — the Jolly Sommelier.
