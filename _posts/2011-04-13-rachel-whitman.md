Since moving to Los Angeles from Seattle, Rachel has appeared on stage in the L.A. premiere of the romantic comedy ‘Elemental Beings,’ and on screen in the dark drama ‘Breakdown at El Mirage’ and the comic adventure ‘Split Second.’ *Napoleon Bon Appétit* is Rachel’s first online project. She would like to thank the cast and crew for being *les meilleurs*.
