Heidi Schooler loved playing the “cheese-ball” Interviewer (some association to food here…) in *Napolean Bon Appetit’s* Valentine’s Day episode of Season 2!

Recent film &amp; TV credits include *CSI-NY*, *Medium*, and *The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena* videogame, (w/Vin Diesel) based on the film *The Chronicles of Riddick*. She portrayed Hedy Lamarr for Mischief Films/BBC’s movie *Calling Hedy Lamarr*, about Hedy Lamarr’s life story, was in *Beautiful Dreamer*, a WWII, 1940’s poignant film (w/Brooke Langton). Recent theatre: National tour of original musical *Stand Through the Eyes of a Child* (w/Marla Gibbs), &amp; as cancer patient Danielle in Mark Goffman’s play, *Me Too* at the Stella Adler Theatre.

Heidi’s favorite foods: NY Friendly’s ice cream flavor “Butter Crunch”= butterscotch ice cream w/pieces of butterscotch candy in it, &amp; is most happy eating chocolate of any kind!
