Robert Walters is…you guessed it, an actor! Ten points and a cookie for those of you who guessed right. Robert has been making the rounds in sunny Los Angeles, starring in world-premiere productions of engaging theatre as well as getting his groove on with various films and webseries’. He has recently starred in the brand-new show, “Melodrama,” described quite fittingly as “Shakespeare on crack.” In a good way, he promises.

Robert had a fantastic time being a part of *Napoleon Bon Appétit*, as he can now tell people he was in the NBA and feel better about his complete lack of basketball skills. Much love to the family and friends, and all those who support independent production! Beautiful things like this need to be seen, and if it wasn’t for this, my corset-tightening prowess would never be seen.
