*Napoleon Bon Appétit* was recently named the *[Self-Produced Clip of the Week](http://more.showfax.com/columns/avoice/archives/001267.html)* by [Bonnie Gillespie](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1024379/) in her column [The Actors Voice](http://more.showfax.com/columns/avoice/). From the column:

> I love this so so SO dang much…. It’s absolutely adorable and charming and clever and fun and funny! Short and sweet. Not the typical “actors producing content for themselves” type fare (which tends to be all about showing themselves in their best light, which is fine, but not necessarily what is most castable). And just adorable. Really love the media blitz y’all put together for this….

Be sure to read the [full column](http://more.showfax.com/columns/avoice/archives/001267.html) for the submission email and and the rest of her thoughts on the series. And get ready, a new episode of *Napoleon Bon Appétit* arrives this Wednesday at [Somebody’s Basement](http://somebodysbasement.com/) and [NapoleonBonAppetit.com](http://napoleonbonappetit.com/)!
