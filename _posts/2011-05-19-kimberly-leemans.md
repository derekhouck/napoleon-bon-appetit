After a few years appearing at her local civic theater in Ocala, Florida, Kimberly received her first taste of the film industry as the producer’s assistant in an independent film where, as luck would have it, she was given a small replacement role. After moving to Miami for college, she soon found her way back on set after Warner Brothers Studio chose to shoot a pilot at her campus. Via networking, Kimberly came into contact with several more film productions, and was able to appear as featured background on such shows as *Burn Notice*, *CSI: Miami*, and *Mercy Reef*. She even flew up to New York City to appear in the Pilot of *3 lbs* starring Stanley Tucci and Cynthia Nixon. When she returned to Miami to finish her college semester, she was surprised to find that her father had submitted her in a state-wide contest and that she had already become a top-five finalist. She was to come home and do a photo shoot along with the five other contestants and they would later surprise the winner that summer by having their picture on the cover and a spread in Florida’s *Ocala Magazine*. She won. That year Kimberly took the next leap to be in front of the cameras, both TV and photo, and auditioned for cycle 9 of *America’s Next Top Model* and became one of the 13 finalist to make it in “the house”. After the season aired Kimberly decided to pursue her career further by moving to New York City. Since arriving in July of 2008, Kimberly has succeeded in earning her SAG card and continued to work on such diverse and popular shows as *Gossip Girl*, *Life on Mars*, *Cupid*, *Law and Order*, and HBO’s *How to Make It in America*. She is also the upcoming campaign model for “Palmers Hair Shampoo” and has been on several other Florida magazine covers, as well as being displayed within the contents of *Cosmopolitan* and *Unvogue*. Kimberly is a very passionate animal activist and has been a vegetarian for several years. She is a major supporter of the animal rights movement and has been personally involved as well, doing such things as cleaning kennels, heading socialization programs, setting up fund raisers, and promoting the importance of animal population control.
