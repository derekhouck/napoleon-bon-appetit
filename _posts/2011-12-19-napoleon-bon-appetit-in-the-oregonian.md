[Grant Butler](http://connect.oregonlive.com/user/gbutler/index.html "Grant Butler, The Oregonian") at The Oregonian wrote a fantastic piece about Napoleon Bon Appétit in their [FOODday section](http://www.oregonlive.com/foodday/ "FOODday"):

> Think of “Napoleon Bon Appétit” as a cooking show with a complex. This original Web series features Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte (actor Derek Houck) and his Kitchen Wench (Katherine Browning) as the hosts of their own cooking show, where they whip up things like Chicken Cordon Bleu and banana crepes with Imperial flair. Now you can catch each 3- to 5-minute episode from the first two seasons in high definition on blip.tv, which can be streamed on your laptop, tablet, smartphone and even your television with Web access. No screen is safe from Napoleonic cooking!
