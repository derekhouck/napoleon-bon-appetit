The brown hair, blue-eyed director is an accomplished actor who made his Directorial debut with the award winning short film “A Pornographer” and is excited to trade-in his acting hat again (for the moment) to direct this web series. “It was a pleasure working with stars Derek Houck and Katherine Browning,” said Campbell. “They brought vivid characters to the project and made every adjustment easy and fun. We laughed a lot during the making of this season and I hope that carries through to the audience.”

Campbell was born in Honolulu, Hawaii and grew up on various bases as a “Navy” kid from San Diego, California to Ft. Collins, Colorado until 6th grade when he moved to Greeley, Colorado. He was graduated from the University of Northern Colorado in Greeley with a Bachelor of Arts in Theatre and an acting emphasis. He is a member of SAG, AFTRA, Actors Equity, and currently resides in Los Angeles with his wife and two kids.
