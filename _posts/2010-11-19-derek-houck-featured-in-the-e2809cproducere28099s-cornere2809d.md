Writer and series co-creator Derek Houck was recently interviewed by Patrick Bardwell of Slebisodes Web Series Guide about producing *Napoleon Bon Appétit*. Among the many things he was asked was how his involvement with the web series began. From the interview:

> My best friend, Katherine Browning, came up with the original idea for *Napoleon Bon Appétit* as a cooking show starring Napoleon Bonaparte. I thought it was hilarious, and decided to write a script for it. Before I knew it, I had 11 episodes written (which we whittled down to seven for our first season) and we began to seriously consider whether we could film this ourselves.
