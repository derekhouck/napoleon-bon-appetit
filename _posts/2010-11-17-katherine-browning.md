Katherine Browning resembles a virginal pirate. Her wholesome and adventurous nature makes for a unique actress. Innocent enough to be hopeful and risky enough to practice imperfection, Katherine isn’t afraid to get her peg leg dirty on projects. She believes that the best way to find the buried treasure called “acting success” is to produce her own work. You can learn more about her pirating tales at [www.thefuckitbucket.com](http://www.thefuckitbucket.com).
